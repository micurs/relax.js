relax.js
=====================================

Intro
--------

Relax.js is a simple node framework for building RESTful web application in Typescript using node.js.

Relax.js is written in Typescript but it does not require the use of Typescript. You can use this framework using javascript.

The spirit of this library is to encourage a fully REST approach whan developing web services.
In Relax.js you implement *resources* as instances of classes implementing the Resource interface and add these instance to
the Site object.

Applications written with relax.js do not require you to specify any routing since the path in a URL call specify a resource.
